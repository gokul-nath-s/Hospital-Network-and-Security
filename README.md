*A secure and scalable network design for a leading healthcare provider in Australia.*

This repository showcases a comprehensive network infrastructure design for **Melbourne Health Services**, a leading healthcare provider in Australia. The project aimed to design and implement a **secure, scalable, and cost-effective network** across two locations: the main headquarters and a branch hospital.

---

## üè• **Project Overview**
Melbourne Health Services decided to transition from third-party IT services to an **in-house network infrastructure** to better manage operations, enhance security, and ensure seamless communication between its departments and locations. This project adheres to the **CIA triad principles** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to protect sensitive healthcare data.

---

## üéØ **Key Objectives**
- Establish **Local Area Networks (LANs)** for departmental operations.
- Implement a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connecting headquarters and the branch hospital.
- Deploy a **dedicated server-side site** hosting DHCP, DNS, Web, and Email services.
- Ensure **secure communication** between sites using VPNs and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

---

## üìå **Design Highlights**
- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Implemented a three-layer architecture (Core, Distribution, Access) for redundancy and scalability.
- **VLAN Configuration & Subnetting**: Created isolated VLANs and subnetworks for each department to optimize traffic and enhance security.
- **Dynamic & Static IP Addressing**: Configured DHCP servers for dynamic IP management and assigned static IPs to critical servers.
- **Wireless Networking**: Set up wireless networks for user mobility across all departments.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Enabled inter-department communication via multilayer switches.
- **Secure Communication**: Established **IPSec VPN tunnels** for encrypted data transmission between sites.
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured **OSPF** for dynamic routing and **static routing** for efficient traffic flow.
- **Access Control & Port Security**: Applied extended ACLs and configured port security to restrict unauthorized access.
- **PAT Configuration**: Implemented Port Address Translation to optimize external traffic routing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Technologies**
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Used for designing, configuring, and simulating the network infrastructure.
- **Routing and Switching**: Multilayer switches for inter-VLAN routing and routers for WAN connectivity.
- **Security Features**: SSH, ACLs, and port security for secure device management and access.

---

## üí° **Key Outcomes**
- **Operational Efficiency**: Improved inter-departmental and inter-location communication.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensured data protection and strict access control.
- **Scalability**: Designed a network ready to scale with organizational growth.
- **Skill Development**: Strengthened expertise in advanced networking, security, and performance optimization.

---

## üìä **Network Requirements**
- **IP Addressing**: Subnetted the base network `192.168.100.0/24` to allocate IPs for all departments.
- **Hardware**: Core routers, multilayer switches, and access switches per location.
- **Security**: Extended ACLs, SSH for secure remote access, and port security using the sticky method.
- **Connectivity**: Serial connections between HQ and Branch, and PAT for ISP connections.
- **Dynamic Routing**: OSPF protocol for optimal routing and performance.

---

## üîç **Project Testing**
- Ensured all devices in the network communicated effectively.
- Verified VPN tunnels and encrypted communication.
- Tested IP allocation via DHCP and static IPs for servers.
- Validated routing tables for OSPF and static routing configurations.
- Checked access restrictions with ACLs and port security.
